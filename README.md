# phonathon-board

The update board for lazy supervisors. Available at [phonathon-board](https://nguyenhuyanhh.github.io/phonathon-board/).

## Development Notes

This website is built using [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Feel free to clone and upgrade it, it's pretty much a work-in-progress.

Supervisors could:

- update the google spreadsheet
- watch the pledges show up in almost real-time!
